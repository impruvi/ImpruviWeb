                    The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.
                </div>

                <h3>Purchasing process</h3>
                <div>
                    Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The purchasing process includes these steps:
                </div>
                <div>
                    • Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.

                <h3>Order submission</h3>
                <div>
                    When the User submits an order, the following applies:
                </div>
                <div>
                    • The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the
                    obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
                </div>
                <div>
                    • In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of
                    personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission
                    creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
                </div>
                <div>
                    • Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.
                </div>
                <div>
                    All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.
                </div>

                <h3>Prices</h3>
                <div>
                    Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Prices on this Application are displayed:
                </div>
                <div>

                </div>

                <h3>Methods of payment</h3>
                <div>
                    Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases
                    related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Application.
                </div>
                <div>
                    All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore,
                    this Application does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details –
                    but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.
                </div>
                <div>
                    If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider,
                    the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfill the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees
                    resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.
                </div>

                <h3>Retention of usage rights</h3>
                <div>

                <h3>Delivery</h3>
                <h4>Performance of services</h4>

                <h3>Contract duration</h3>

                    Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment is received by the Owner.

                <div>
                    In order to maintain subscriptions, Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner. Failure to do so may cause service interruptions.

                <div>
                    Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.
                </div>

                <h4>Who the right of withdrawal applies to</h4>
                <div>
                    Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted
                    a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online
                    (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.
                </div>

                <h4>Exercising the right of withdrawal</h4>
                <div>
                    To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.
                </div>
                <div>
                    To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section
                    of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract
                    by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within
                    which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.
                </div>
                <div>
                    When does the withdrawal period expire?
                </div>
                <div>
                    • In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium, the withdrawal period
                    expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.
                </div>

                <h4>Effects of withdrawal</h4>
                <div>
                    Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made
                    to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.
                </div>
                <div>
                    However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than
                    the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from
                    the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless
                    otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used
                    to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a
                    result of such reimbursement.
                </div>
            </div>

                    State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified

                    errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components.
                    Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at

                    The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service
                    advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service,

                    Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations of
                    certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives Users
                    specific legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The
                    disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

                    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries,

                    • personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access to or use of the Service;

                    This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the

                    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,

                    legal rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.
                    The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms shall not apply to the
                    extent prohibited by applicable law.
